# Brief
I created a basic JavaScript page which would run a calculator simulation i.e.
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, square-roots, BMI.
the numbers came from the users input.

# Difficulties
* One Difficulty I had was in the begging I was trying to calculate some answers but it
was returning something wrong, I then noticed that I was adding a string to a number, so i added the "parseInt" and then got the correct answer.

# What Im most pleased with
* I am most pleased that my calculator runs properly and displays the correct answer
for each part of the calculator.
* I learnt a lot from this homework, I learnt a lot from my mistakes which will help
me not to make them in the future.
